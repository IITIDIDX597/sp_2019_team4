Intermittent social runners
Benefit from targeted internal data and external data
In order to assess and enhance race performance in an engaging manner.

SubHill:
The platform has all the previous race data about the runner which is visible to the runner.

By looking at the analyzed data, the runner learns about one's own performance, for individual races and for multiple races over time. The runner also can get ideas of how to make the next race 'better' (for whatever goals the runner may have for the next race).

Story:
As an intermittent social runner
I want to know my past performances in a succinct race report overview
So that I know what progress I am making towards my personal goals

Acceptance Criteria:
Given I'm an intermittent social runner with RAM account with participation in at least one RAM race
When I log in my account and go to race history section
Then I have a visual report where I can compare my performance in different races with my personal goal and see my trajectory
