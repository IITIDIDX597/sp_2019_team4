For individual races, if runner chooses to use the application during the race, the runner gets real-time feedback and support with audio notifications while running.

Story:
As an intermittent social runner
I want to know my in-race performance for each race
So that I know how to hone my strengths and improve my weaknesses in order to increase overall race performance

Acceptance Criteria:
Given I'm an intermittent social runner who ran in a RAM race
When I click on 'detailed peformance report'
Then I can see finely divided interval paces, trends among the intervals, mapped with elevation gain/loss of each interval
