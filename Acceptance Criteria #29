Story:
As an intermittent social runner
I want the option to be matched with other RAM runners who have similar goals/performance records/address/interests
So that I can train with people who can compliment and challenge me

Acceptance Criteria:
Given I'm an intermittent social runner who is a top 10% performer of the 5k races in historical average within a particular 'age +gender' subgroup
When I opt in to see recommended connections on RAM website or app
Then I can see and have option to message people who are within the same subgroup who also plan to attend the next race I signed up for
