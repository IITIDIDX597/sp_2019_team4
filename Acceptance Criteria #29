Story:
As an intermittent social runner
I want the option to be matched with other RAM runners who have similar goals/performance records/address/interests
So that I can train with people who can compliment and challenge me

Acceptance Criteria:
Given I'm an intermittent social runner who has been RAM user for a long period and I have a RAM account with the record of my racing performance
When Afte I sign in the RAM platform, I go to the report page and building connection/trainning category
Then I can see multiple options about different groups of RAM runners
Then I can choose if I want to training with them
