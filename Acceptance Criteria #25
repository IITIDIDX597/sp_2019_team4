Intermittent social runners
Benefit from targeted internal data and external data
In order to assess and enhance race performance in an engaging manner.

SubHill:
For individual races, if runner chooses to use the application during the race, the runner gets real-time feedback and support with audio notifications while running.

Story:
As an intermittent social runner
I want to visually see lapsed timings during the race
So that I can manage and adjust my pace wisely

Acceptance Criteriaï¼š
Given I'm an intermittent social runner who is attending the RAM race
When I do a simple interaction on my mobile device
Then I can see the real-time lapsed timing by notification on the mibile device
