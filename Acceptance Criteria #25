Hill:
Intermittent social runners
Benefit from targeted internal data and external data
In order to assess and enhance race performance in an engaging manner.

SubHill:
For individual races, if runner chooses to use the application during the race, the runner gets real-time feedback and support with audio notifications while running.

Story:
As an intermittent social runner
I want to visually see lapsed timings during the race
So that I can manage and adjust my pace wisely

Acceptance Criteria :
Given I'm an intermittent social runner who is running in a RAM race
When I hit a mile marker with a clock in the race as I run
Then I see the time lapsed since my corral started the races (as opposed to when the race started for the first corral, which is usually the elite corral)
