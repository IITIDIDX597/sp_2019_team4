Hill:
Intermittent social runners
Benefit from targeted internal data and external data
In order to assess and enhance race performance in an engaging manner.

SubHill:
An intermittent social runner signs up for a RAM-organized race through the consolidated web platform (a website + mobile app, to which runners can log on any time, from anywhere).
&
The platform has all the previous race data about the runner which is visible to the runner.

Story:
As an intermittent social runner
I want access to both RAM website and mobile app
So that I have access to appropriate level of RAM information at any time and place

Acceptance Criteria
Given I'm an intermittent social runner, I downloaded the RAM application and I'm accessible to RAM websit
When I sign up my RAM account and sign in on the website or application
Then I can see my pervious race data on the website or application
