The platform also allows the runner to access race photos and analytics in a visually pleasing and comprehensive format (to record what the runner may have felt like at certain points and/or if anything interesting happened etc). This is ready to be shared with other runners within the RAM community, with people the runner is connected to various social media networks such as Instagram, Facebook etc, and with people on other running/training apps such as Strava, Nike Run+ etc. People can comment and tag other people to this digital sharing.

Story:
As an intermittent social runner
I want to have timestamped in-race photos mapped to the race map
So that I know what my pace was from point to point, gait, and what I looked/felt like in the race

Acceptance Criteria:
Given I'm an intermittent social runner who finished running in a RAM race where there were photographers taking photos of runners at certain intervals
When I login to RAM website or app and view photos from most recent race
Then I get to view all my photos taken during the race mapped to each location along the course the photos were taken
